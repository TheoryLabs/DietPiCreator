  "description": "[üç∫Ô∏èTheoryLabs/DietPiCreator] Repo includes a slew of tools for crafting customized, self-tailored versions of DietPi [Michalng/DietPi (github.com/MichaIng/DietPi)]. For now, tools reflect building against fork of DietPi master Github repository (see https://github.com/TheoryLabs/DietPi). Just until a more logical path for development (i.e. e2e testing, unit tests, CI, etc.) is figured out. For more in-depth detail on what this is all about, as well as where to get started, see README.  ",
